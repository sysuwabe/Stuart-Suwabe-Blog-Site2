## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# census_api_key("41dcf38aad5e9257d3d377a226d8f5ce88274d23", install = TRUE) 

PubTransBelPov <- get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B08122_014", state = "CA", year = 2019)
PubTransBelPov1 <- PubTransBelPov %>% rename(county = NAME, PubTransBelPov = estimate) %>% select(county, PubTransBelPov)
PubTransInPov <- get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B08122_015", state = "CA", year = 2019)
PubTransInPov1 <- PubTransInPov %>% rename(county = NAME, PubTransInPov = estimate) %>% select(county, PubTransInPov)
# number of people in poverty that take public transportation

PubTransPov <- merge(PubTransBelPov1, PubTransInPov1, by = "county")
PubTransData <- PubTransPov %>% mutate(PubTransPov = PubTransBelPov + PubTransInPov) %>% select(c(county, PubTransPov))

FoodAssist <- get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B09010_002", state = "CA", year = 2019)
FoodAssist1 <- FoodAssist %>% rename(county = NAME, FoodAssist = estimate) %>% select(county, FoodAssist)
# number of people who rely on SSI, food stamps, or other support

EduHSBelow <- get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B06009_002", state = "CA", year = 2019)
EduHSBelow1 <- EduHSBelow %>% rename(county = NAME, EduHSBelow = estimate) %>% select(county, EduHSBelow)
# number of people not graduated high school

EduHSGrad <- get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B06009_003", state = "CA", year = 2019)
EduHSGrad1 <- EduHSGrad %>% rename(county = NAME, EduHSGrad = estimate) %>% select(county, EduHSGrad)
# number of people who graduated high school

EduSomeCol <- get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B06009_004", state = "CA", year = 2019)
EduSomeCol1 <- EduSomeCol %>% rename(county = NAME, EduSomeCol = estimate) %>% select(county, EduSomeCol)
# number of people with some college

EduBach <- get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B06009_005", state = "CA", year = 2019)
EduBach1 <- EduBach %>% rename(county = NAME, EduBach = estimate) %>% select(county, EduBach)
# number of people with a Bachelor's Degree

x19test2 <- merge(foodin19a, PubTransData, by = "county")
x19test3 <- merge(x19test2, FoodAssist1, by = "county")
x19test4 <- merge(x19test3, EduHSBelow1, by = "county")
x19test5 <- merge(x19test4, EduHSGrad1, by = "county")
x19test6 <- merge(x19test5, EduSomeCol1, by = "county")
x19test7 <- merge(x19test6, EduBach1, by = "county")

foodinca <- x19test7[-c(1:3,6:9,11,12,16)]

# I had to do my own research for how many food pantries are in each county. This is inconclusive, but I deem this data important. 
foodinca$pantry_num <- c(20,20,15,49,15,6,54,8,12,41,8,16,13,17,30,28,38,7,30,10,11,3,10,8,4,11,30,9,10,95,33,9,41,37,6,111,39,30,42,42,12,53,25,13,11,5,5,25,16,30,14,3,4,21,11,190,60,12)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
foodincaPercen <- foodinca %>% 
  mutate(PubTransPov = PubTransPov / population) %>%
  mutate(FoodAssist = FoodAssist / population) %>% 
  mutate(EduHSBelow = EduHSBelow / population) %>% 
  mutate(EduHSGrad = EduHSGrad / population) %>% 
  mutate(EduSomeCol = EduSomeCol / population) %>% 
  mutate(EduBach = EduBach / population) %>% 
  select(-c(2,5,9,17))

foodincaNum <- foodinca %>% 
  mutate(child_below_poverty_percen = child_below_poverty_percen * insecure_child_num) %>% # even though it says percen, treat it as a number, not a percentage 
  mutate(insecure_low_income = insecure_low_income * population) %>%
  select(-c(1,4,9,17))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(caret)

set.seed(504)
m1 <- train(insecure_percen ~ .,
            data = foodincaPercen, 
            method = "lm", 
            trControl = trainControl(number = 1),
            preProcess = c("BoxCox", "center", "scale"))

summary(m1)

library(modelr)
rmse(m1, foodincaPercen) 
```

```{r}
set.seed(504)
m2 <- train(insecure_num ~ .,
            data = foodincaNum, 
            method = "lm", 
            trControl = trainControl(number = 1),
            preProcess = c("BoxCox", "center", "scale"))

summary(m2)

library(modelr)
rmse(m2, foodincaNum) 
```



# All of this is Tidymodels code that I've decided to remove. Maybe I could implement them again once I figured out how they work? Maybe... but I doubt.
