## The Data to Gather

The Map the Meal Gap data from the US Hunger Relief Organization Feeding America offers their percentage-driven population data taking stock of the food insecurity percentage of the overall population, the number of children within this population, income percentages of families with children, and even the average cost of a homemade meal! From such data, results could be drawn that deal with poverty or income. That said, the data is rather limited in this regard. 

It is from this data that the main output of this analysis, the food insecurity percentage, would be found. 

To those familiar with the R coding system, there exists a library that allows access to FRED, the Federal Reserve of Economic Data. From here, more numerically set pieces of population data can be found, with population numbers based on other features like transportation and schooling. Thus we now have a couple more features to look into to figure potential solutions to helping the food insecurity issue. 

## Clean up

After downloading the data, I decided to give the various columns shorter names except the budget shortfall column. It just feels fine enough to keep as is. 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
library(readxl)

foodin19 <- read_excel("~/Downloads/Map the Meal Gap Data/MMG2021_2019Data_ToShare.xlsx", sheet = "2019 County")
foodin19a <- foodin19 %>% rename(county = `County, State`, insecure_percen = `2019 Food Insecurity Rate`, insecure_num = `# of Food Insecure Persons in 2019`, insecure_low_income = `% FI â‰¤ Low Threshold`, insecure_btwn_income = `% FI Btwn Thresholds`, insecure_high_income = `% FI > High Threshold`, insecure_child_percen = `2019 Child food insecurity rate`, insecure_child_num = `# of Food Insecure Children in 2019`, child_below_poverty_percen = `% food insecure children in HH w/ HH incomes below 185 FPL in 2019`, child_above_poverty_percen = `% food insecure children in HH w/ HH incomes above 185 FPL in 2019`, secure_meal_value = `2019 Cost Per Meal`)  %>% filter(State == "CA") %>% mutate(population = round(insecure_num / insecure_percen, digits = 0))
```

To get data from FREDR, you need a census api key, something I cannot show. That said, once you have this api key, you can draw data from the FREDR database. 

I chose to focus on two specific population numbers for this data: public transportation and education level. Notably I considered everyone in the population and did not parse separate columns by race or gender. The way I see it, making change should be able to affect everyone, and the idea of certain genders and races being discriminated is both obvious and all-encompassing, so I decided to not include it as an extra factor. 

```{r}
# census_api_key("41dcf38aad5e9257d3d377a226d8f5ce88274d23", install = TRUE)

PubTransBelPov <- get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B08122_014", state = "CA", year = 2019)
PubTransBelPov1 <- PubTransBelPov %>% rename(county = NAME, PubTransBelPov = estimate) %>% select(county, PubTransBelPov)
PubTransInPov <- get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B08122_015", state = "CA", year = 2019)
PubTransInPov1 <- PubTransInPov %>% rename(county = NAME, PubTransInPov = estimate) %>% select(county, PubTransInPov)
# number of people in poverty that take public transportation in the really low and mid-poverty percentiles 

# basically add them both together
PubTransPov <- merge(PubTransBelPov1, PubTransInPov1, by = "county")
PubTransData <- PubTransPov %>% mutate(PubTransPov = PubTransBelPov + PubTransInPov) %>% select(c(county, PubTransPov))

FoodAssist <- get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B09010_002", state = "CA", year = 2019)
FoodAssist1 <- FoodAssist %>% rename(county = NAME, FoodAssist = estimate) %>% select(county, FoodAssist)
# number of people who rely on SSI, food stamps, or other support

EduHSBelow <- get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B06009_002", state = "CA", year = 2019)
EduHSBelow1 <- EduHSBelow %>% rename(county = NAME, EduHSBelow = estimate) %>% select(county, EduHSBelow)
# number of people not graduated high school

EduHSGrad <- get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B06009_003", state = "CA", year = 2019)
EduHSGrad1 <- EduHSGrad %>% rename(county = NAME, EduHSGrad = estimate) %>% select(county, EduHSGrad)
# number of people who graduated high school

EduSomeCol <- get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B06009_004", state = "CA", year = 2019)
EduSomeCol1 <- EduSomeCol %>% rename(county = NAME, EduSomeCol = estimate) %>% select(county, EduSomeCol)
# number of people with some college

EduBach <- get_acs(geography = "county", variables = "B06009_005", state = "CA", year = 2019)
EduBach1 <- EduBach %>% rename(county = NAME, EduBach = estimate) %>% select(county, EduBach)
# number of people with a Bachelor's Degree

x19test2 <- merge(foodin19a, PubTransData, by = "county")
x19test3 <- merge(x19test2, FoodAssist1, by = "county")
x19test4 <- merge(x19test3, EduHSBelow1, by = "county")
x19test5 <- merge(x19test4, EduHSGrad1, by = "county")
x19test6 <- merge(x19test5, EduSomeCol1, by = "county")
x19test7 <- merge(x19test6, EduBach1, by = "county")

foodinca <- x19test7[-c(1:3,6:9,11,12,16)]

# I had to do my own research for how many food pantries are in each county. This is inconclusive and most certainly inaccurate since data for this doesn't exist, but I think having this data is important. 
foodinca$pantry_num <- c(20,20,15,49,15,6,54,8,12,41,8,16,13,17,30,28,38,7,30,10,11,3,10,8,4,11,30,9,10,95,33,9,41,37,6,111,39,30,42,42,12,53,25,13,11,5,5,25,16,30,14,3,4,21,11,190,60,12)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Now, the data itself was split between both numerical values and percentage values, so I decided to make two separate versions of the data set: one with all percentages, the other with all numbers. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
foodincaPercen <- foodinca %>% 
  mutate(PubTransPov = PubTransPov / population) %>%
  mutate(FoodAssist = FoodAssist / population) %>% 
  mutate(EduHSBelow = EduHSBelow / population) %>% 
  mutate(EduHSGrad = EduHSGrad / population) %>% 
  mutate(EduSomeCol = EduSomeCol / population) %>% 
  mutate(EduBach = EduBach / population) %>% 
  select(-c(2,5,9,17))

foodincaNum <- foodinca %>% 
  mutate(child_below_poverty_percen = child_below_poverty_percen * insecure_child_num) %>% # even though it says percen, treat it as a number, not a percentage 
  mutate(insecure_low_income = insecure_low_income * population) %>%
  select(-c(1,4,9,17))
```

Now I can compare data. 

Looking at pantry data, there is an obvious telling that higher pantry numbers have lower percentages of food insecurity. Even with the raw way I scraped up the pantry data, the results remain logical. The outlier at 190 counties is Ventura County, with the second largest at 111 pantries is San Bernadino County. 

```{r}
foodincaPercen %>% ggplot(aes(insecure_percen, pantry_num)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("More food pantries mean a lower insecurity rate")
```

Looking at the average amount of money it costs for a single meal, surprisingly enough, the higher the cost, the lower the food insecurity rate. You would expect it the other way around, but logically speaking, a county with a higher meal cost would probably be larger or have larger cities, with more resources to deal with food insecure individuals than smaller counties. Then, higher costs would account for more nutrition within a meal. 

```{r}
foodincaPercen %>% ggplot(aes(insecure_percen, secure_meal_value)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("the higher the meal cost, the lower the insecurity rate")
```

This was an interesting move. In simple terms, we have the minimum budget the government could use to allocate food for the county. While higher budgets generally mean lower food insecurity percentages, there is one massive outlier, with a budget of 640 million! This county is actually Los Angeles county. I'll have to keep an eye on this one. 

```{r}
foodincaPercen %>% ggplot(aes(insecure_percen, `2019 Weighted Annual Food Budget Shortfall`)) + geom_point()
```

Looking at the percentage of people that utilize public transportation, there are outliers on both axes. At almost 4% of the population, Mono County is the outlier. Imperial County has by far the highest insecurity percentage. 

```{r}
foodincaPercen %>% ggplot(aes(insecure_percen, PubTransPov)) + geom_point()
```

Looking at this same plot with everything translated into population numbers, Los Angeles once again pulls ahead with an outlier of over 1 million people suffering from food insecurity, but it also pulls ahead with over 80 thousand people taking public transportation. 

```{r}
foodincaNum %>% ggplot(aes(insecure_num, PubTransPov)) + geom_point()
```

I have added together the population numbers that involved people whose highest educational level is high school education. The more of them there are, the overall higher insecurity rate. Los Angeles once more remains as an outlier in the number-variant of the data. 

```{r}
foodincaPercen %>% ggplot(aes(insecure_percen, EduHSBelow + EduHSGrad)) + geom_point()
```


```{r}
foodincaNum %>% ggplot(aes(insecure_num, EduHSBelow + EduHSGrad)) + geom_point()
```

Loa Angeles is a clear outlier in the numeric data set, while not being as prevalent in the percentage data set. I should look at a histogram. 

```{r}
foodincaPercen %>% ggplot(aes(insecure_percen)) + geom_histogram(bins = 25)

```
```{r}
foodincaNum %>% ggplot(aes(insecure_num)) + geom_histogram(bins = 25)

```

Yeah... especially for numeric data set, the frequency is skewed towards the left. 


```{r}
foodincaPercen %>% ggplot(aes(log(insecure_percen))) + geom_histogram(bins = 25)
```

```{r}
foodincaNum %>% ggplot(aes(log(insecure_num))) + geom_histogram(bins = 25)
```

The frequency of both data set while having the output logged has led to a more even distribution. I should have this in my model.
