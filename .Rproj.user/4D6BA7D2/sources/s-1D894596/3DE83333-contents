Here is the idea to go by: 

# Overview (1 paragraph)

The pandemic has led to a loss in jobs and food insecurity for many people, thus they may rely on a weekly visit to a food bank to at least keep one life issue out of the way. As the pandemic lets up, however, will food pantries continue to have the numbers they have had before? I wish to look at food security data and look at the future of food insecurity in the United States. 

# Context (2 paragraphs)

Perhaps more important than having a roof above your head would be the need for the energy to sustain oneself. Food insecurity has always been an issue that has persisted in today's society, though it seems implicity considered as part of or a result of unemployment or wage issues. Food banks and pantries, especially during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, do their best to help alleviate at least one issue a struggling person or family may face via providing the food to help them focus on their other problems. 

As the pandemic lets up, however, there is the idea that food insecurity will continue to persist and may even increase, even after the economy begins to come back. The way I see it, any new information and insights that can be gained about food insecurity would help us not only predict and prepare for it, but may also help give ideas as to deal with it. 

# Proposal (3 paragraphs)

The specific question I intend to find is rather simple: will food insecurity increase in the future, or have we seen signs of potential decrease? With the nature of the pandemic on our society changing each week and each day, predicting whether insecurity will increase or even stay stagnant will help us better prepare (ie: have food banks stock food) as the pandemic lets up. 

I intend to look at two data sets: both are food insecurity surveys, one from 2019, and one from 2020. The idea is to analyze them both with the same output to predict, giving a general direction as to whether food insecurity is increasing or decreasing, and the factors in the surveys that most contribute to them. Maybe having a third survey would help figure the direction food insecurity could be going, either for 2018, or one for part of 2021. 

Looking at articles online about the subject, I honestly expect there to be an overall increase in food insecurity. I hope it decreases, but it is clear that the pandemic has changed many things about our lives and society permanently, and not everyone will be able to bounce back, not even the restaurants that have closed because of it. Specifically, in the areas where food banks have more customers, I hope there will be less predicted food insecurity. 

# Conclusion (2-3 paragraphs)

Food insecurity is an issue, and though we try, it's constant mentions in the news is worrying to people. I wish to look into food insecurity and predict if there will be more or less insecurity. To do this, I will look at food insecurity data from multiple years, especially what they have to say about demographics, and use both to build up my findings and results. Perhaps this idea could be expanded to other issues like homelessness using homeless shelter data, or unemployment with state pension data. 

There are, of course, quite a few limitations to speak of here. Mainly, it'd be the matter of finding such information and in a recent state too. The pandemic is still going, and "normalcy" is still far away, so data gathering will probably be more difficult. While I'm not sure about future directions for the project, the aforementioned expansion into homelessness or unemployment could work with these data sets. Short of deciding to focus on something else within the data, perhaps a tighter focus on families with children specifically could yield some results.
