<p>Here is the idea to go by.</p>
<div id="overview-1-paragraph" class="section level1">
<h1>Overview (1 paragraph)</h1>
<p>The pandemic has led to an increase in food insecurity for many people, leading to over 50 million people suffering for enough food, and as the pandemic lets up, the situation has not gotten better. More and more people need food, and I’ve seen this for myself at the pantry I volunteer at. It’s clear that widespread action against food insecurity would take much more than we can muster at the moment. But I believe that, if we target what is most pressing about the people who suffer from food insecurity, we can begin to turn the situation around. With this data, I hope to make it clear to the people and to our lawmakers what needs to be done to help curb this famine in the land of plenty.</p>

<h1>Context (2 paragraphs)</h1>
<p>Perhaps more important than having a roof above your head would be the need for the energy to sustain oneself. Food insecurity has always been an issue that has persisted in today’s society, though it seems implicitly considered as part of or a result of unemployment or wage issues. Food banks and pantries, especially during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, do their best to help alleviate at least one issue a struggling person or family may face via providing the food to help them focus on their other problems.</p>
<p>As the pandemic lets up, however, food insecurity will continue to persists and may even increase, even after the economy begins to come back. In 2020 we were up to 50 million people in the United States without enough sustenance, nutritional or otherwise, and there are no signs of this issue slowing down at all. The way I see it, any new information and insights that can be gained about food insecurity would help us not only predict and prepare for it, but may also help give ideas as to deal with it.</p>

<div id="proposal-3-paragraphs" class="section level1">
<h1>Proposal (3 paragraphs)</h1>
<p>The specific question I intend to find is rather simple: what are the aspects of food insecurity in the population that needs to be looked at the most? The pandemic’s influence and impact will last even after the virus is eradicated, and as the struggle for enough food continues in today’s society, any information that we can glean about the population and their struggles will be one more step forward towards dealing with this seemingly insurmountable issue at hand. Giving the public this knowledge will hopefully push lawmakers and give them the insight necessary to tackle this problem.</p>
<p>I intend to look at a food insecurity data set from 2019, the latest year that I could find data on this topic. With the massive increase in those suffering from food insecurity in 2020, the idea is that the inferences found through this analysis may give reason for the increase in the first place. The output of the analysis will be the “2019 Food Insecurity Rate” column. The reason why I chose this column over the “# of Food Insecure Persons in 2019” column is that the former looks at the percentage of the population in each county, and since each county would have different populations, there would be more to skew and edit had I went with simply the number of people suffering from food insecurity. There are three variables that have listed the percentages of food insecure people who have low, mid, and high income thresholds, the percentage and number of children under 18 who are food insecure, and two more that look at children above and below the 185% Federal poverty line, which dictates their validity for meal programs. There are also two factors looking at the cost of a meal for food secure individuals and a budget shortfall for the cost of food per week multiplied by the geographic population of each county. Currently, I am exploring the data so I could hopefully use more of these columns, like the highest and lowest gross income limits for federal nutritional programs or maybe segmenting the fifty states into larger regions in the US. The simple goal would be to find the features that have the most weight on the food insecurity percentage with a decision tree via TidyModels. A linear model with the most important nodes of the decision tree would then help focus on the one of two most important features to present and talk about.</p>
<p>Despite the articles that have expounded on the persistence of food insecurity up to now, there is the chance I could use another dataset I have to utilize a time series on the increase or decrease in people suffering from food insecurity over time from the beginning from 2021 as a bit of extra data, but it is not as important right now. Despite what human nature would want, change to decrease food insecurity will be slow and for the long term, even with the results of this analysis. However, these results may help give a starting boost as to which direction to take to tackle this issue. We could already run similar analyses on prior data stretching as far as 2010, but having similar data for 2020 and onward would help give continuous information on the food insecurity problem with the same features utilized, allowing for either tweaks or changes in law made and actions done by the populace.</p>

<div id="conclusion-2-3-paragraphs" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion (2-3 paragraphs)</h1>
<p>Food insecurity is an issue, and though we try, it’s constant mentions in the news is worrying to people. I wish to look into food insecurity and reason the main factors or groups that contribute to this issue with the aim to rectify the situations they present. To do this, I will look at food insecurity data from 2019 to build up my findings and results. There is also the chance of using information overtime to predict the current food insecurity problem into the future. With a similar algorithm utilizing data from across the years, we could track the overarching issues causing food insecurity and hopefully begin to tackle them help the people.</p>
<p>The main limitation here would be that the data is from 2019. I would hope for 2020 data for a more accurate position on the topic at hand, but I could not find it at the moment. I would have to reason that the 2019 data would only be exacerbated in the 2020 data, and gather inferences from what I could glean online. Perhaps there could be more features to look at for my analysis, but finding data on the subject is tough. I think I can do well with what I have, but more features would be nice.</p>
